# Accessibility Testing

### For Accessibility testing I have also used an online tool called wave :
[Gatling](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/)

### Explanation:
Once you enter into the website you can see the report on the left hand panel.

1.It has given errors for the elements that do not have labels.

2. Missing Lang attribute. The HTML Lang attribute is used to identify the language of text content on the web.

3. There was no page regions. Landmark roles (or "landmarks") programmatically identify sections of a page. Landmarks help assistive technology (AT).
